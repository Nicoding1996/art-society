Interactions and validations
- Prestige Track
  - Drag to reorder; supports tap to move left or right for accessibility
  - Lock prompt appears after first non-zero input across any player
  - Once locked, show lock icon with hint Locked after scoring begins
- Steppers
  - Range 0–20; long-press accelerates
  - Exceeding bounds gives gentle shake and hint Max 20
- Eyeline
  - Only the ×5 color shows Eyeline tiles stepper
  - Eyeline clamps to current total for that color with toast Eyeline reduced to match total
- Calculate Scores
  - Disabled until any non-zero input detected
- Save Game
  - Toast Saved to History on success

Accessibility
- Contrast meets AA: navy text on cream, white on navy or gold buttons
- Focus outlines 2–3 px high-contrast on all interactive elements
- Screen reader labels announce diffs, for example Julian total updated plus 6 from eyeline
- Reduced motion respected; disable shimmer when prefers reduced motion
- Color-blind palettes: Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia with preview swatches
- Left-handed mode mirrors layout and control positions for thumb reach

Microcopy inventory
- Eyeline rule: Only the ×5 color earns +3 per eyeline tile. No cap.
- Decor helper: +1 each
- Bonuses: Full Gallery +5, Complete Board +5
- Penalties: Empty corners −2 each; Unplaced paintings −2 each
- Prestige hint: Locked after scoring begins
- Bounds: Max 20
- Clamp: Eyeline reduced to match total
- Save: Saved to History
- Empty states
  - History: No saved games yet. Play a game and save results.
  - Leaderboard: No leaderboard yet. Save games to build stats.

Scoring model
- Per-color subtotal = tiles × assigned multiplier
- Eyeline bonus = eyeline tiles × 3 for the ×5 color only
- Decor points = decor tiles × 1
- Bonuses = Full Gallery 5 plus Complete Board 5
- Penalties = empty corners × 2 plus unplaced paintings × 2
- Final score = sum of per-color subtotals plus eyeline bonus plus decor plus bonuses minus penalties

Acceptance tests for scoring
- Example A
  - Prestige order Blue ×5, Green ×4, Red ×3, Yellow ×2
  - Blue tiles 3, eyeline 2 → 3 × 5 = 15, eyeline 2 × 3 = 6
  - Red tiles 2 → 2 × 3 = 6
  - Yellow tiles 0 → 0
  - Green tiles 1 → 1 × 4 = 4
  - Decor 4 → 4
  - Full Gallery on, Complete Board on → 10
  - Penalties: Empty 2 → −4; Unplaced 1 → −2
  - Total = 15 + 6 + 6 + 0 + 4 + 10 − 6 = 35
- Example B
  - Prestige order Red ×5; Red tiles 5 with eyeline 5; others 0
  - Decor 0; bonuses off; penalties 0
  - Total = 5 × 5 + 5 × 3 = 25 + 15 = 40
- Example C
  - Eyeline exceeds total attempt: Red tiles 2, eyeline set to 3 then tiles decreased to 2
  - Result clamps eyeline to 2 and shows toast Eyeline reduced to match total

Responsiveness
- 320 to 375 px: single column, compact paddings; icons 20–24 px
- 390 to 480 px: larger paddings; two-line table rows when needed
- 600 px and up: two-column layout for Player Cards and split results view

Assets for hi-fi
- Medal icons gold silver bronze
- Laurel watermark vector
- Shield icon for decor, minus badge for penalties
- Color chips for four accents with color-blind alternates

Implementation notes
- Use CSS custom properties for palette and spacing
- Load typography via Google Fonts with tabular-nums feature for numbers
- Use aria-live polite for running totals and aria-expanded for breakdown accordions
- Use inert for off-canvas panels and avoid focus traps
## Interactive Components and States — Detailed Spec

Scope
- This section refines interactive behavior, states, accessibility, and left-handed adaptations for all controls described in [docs/ui-ux-spec.md](docs/ui-ux-spec.md).

Global interaction patterns

  - Constraints: once any player input is non-zero, trigger “Lock Prestige order?” modal
    - Confirm locks; Cancel aborts drag
  - Announcement examples: “Blue moved to first. Multiplier ×5”
  - When order changes prior to lock: eyeline input migrates to new ×5 color and previous eyeline value clears (confirm if non-zero)

5) Accordion (View Score Breakdown)
- Anatomy
  - Header row with label and chevron; section divider 1 px navy at 10% opacity
- States

## Data and API Schema — Draft

This section extends the spec in [docs/ui-ux-spec.md](docs/ui-ux-spec.md) with concrete data shapes and service endpoints for History and Leaderboard.

Guiding principles
- Web-first hosted on Vercel, API routes likely under /api
- Authenticated sync planned; anonymous local play should also work (client can persist local and POST when signed in)
- Pagination for history via cursor
- Aggregations computed server-side for Leaderboard

Core entities

Game
- id: string (ULID/UUID)
- createdAt: ISO timestamp
- prestigeOrder: array of 4 items [{ color: red|blue|yellow|green, multiplier: 5|4|3|2 }]
- players: array of Player (2–4 entries)
- notes: optional string (future)
- version: number (ruleset revision)

Player
- id: string
- name: string
- avatarKey: string
- paintings: { red: number, blue: number, yellow: number, green: number } // 0–20
- eyelineCountForX5: number // 0–20, clamped to tiles of ×5 color
- decorCount: number // 0–20
- fullGallery: boolean
- completeBoard: boolean
- penalties: { emptyCorners: number, unplacedPaintings: number } // 0–20
- finalScore: number // computed and persisted with game

Derived computation (documented, not enforced by API)
- perColorSubtotal[color] = paintings[color] × prestige multiplier for that color
- eyelineBonus = eyelineCountForX5 × 3 (only ×5 color)
- decorPoints = decorCount × 1
- bonuses = (fullGallery ? 5 : 0) + (completeBoard ? 5 : 0)
- penalties = emptyCorners × 2 + unplacedPaintings × 2
- finalScore = Σ perColorSubtotal + eyelineBonus + decorPoints + bonuses − penalties

  }
- Notes
  - Ties resolved by avgScore desc then name asc
  - range can be all, 30d, 90d, 1y

Sorting rules
- Results screen: sort players by finalScore desc; ties broken by decorCount desc, then name asc
- Leaderboard: default sort wins desc; ties by avgScore desc; on same avg, highScore desc; finally name asc

Identity and deduplication
- Player identity on Leaderboard is by normalized name (trim, collapse spaces, case-insensitive) unless authenticated profiles are used
- Optionally store stable playerId when available to avoid name collisions

Validation and error handling
- Reject invalid prestigeOrder (duplicates or missing colors)
- Enforce counter ranges 0–20
- Recompute finalScore on server; if client-sent finalScore mismatches, prefer server value
- Return 400 with field-level errors; client shows toast and inline error states

Security and auth (future-ready)
- If authenticated: require token on POST; associate games to user/team/club
- If anonymous: allow POST with rate limiting; store under public bucket until claimed by account

## Acceptance Test Cases — Scoring and Sorting

Scoring — Per-color and Eyeline
1. X5 color eyeline bonus stacks with multiplier
   - Setup: Blue ×5; paintings.blue = 3; eyeline = 2
   - Expect: blue subtotal 3 × 5 = 15; eyeline 2 × 3 = 6; combined blue contribution 21

2. Eyeline clamped to total
   - Setup: Red ×5; paintings.red = 2; eyeline attempt = 3
   - Action: decrease paintings.red to 2
   - Expect: eyeline auto-clamps to 2; toast “Eyeline reduced to match total”

3. Other colors do not earn eyeline
   - Setup: Green ×4, Yellow ×3, Red ×2; Blue ×5
   - Action: attempt to set eyeline on non-×5 color via UI (should be impossible)
   - Expect: eyeline control only visible for ×5 color

4. Upper and lower bounds
   - Setup: stepper at 20; press +; at 0; press −
   - Expect: value remains clamped; gentle boundary animation; hint “Max 20” or “Min 0”

Bonuses and Penalties
5. Decor scoring
   - decorCount = 4 → +4 points

6. Full Gallery and Complete Board stack
   - fullGallery = true; completeBoard = true → +10 total

7. Penalties subtract
   - emptyCorners = 2 → −4; unplacedPaintings = 1 → −2

Totals
8. Combined score calculation
   - Use Example A in spec; Expected total = 35 (or updated to final illustrative sum when figures align)

Sorting
9. Results screen sorting and tie-breakers
   - Two players with same finalScore; higher decorCount ranks above
   - If decorCount equal, name ascending

10. Leaderboard sorting toggle
   - Default by wins desc; tapping Avg toggles to avgScore desc; tapping again toggles to asc; SR announces change

Persistence
11. POST /api/games recompute server-side
   - Send payload with slightly incorrect finalScore
   - Expect: server returns 201; stored game shows corrected finalScore on GET

History pagination
12. GET /api/games paging
   - With limit=2, return 2 items and non-null nextCursor; using nextCursor returns next page

Accessibility
13. Screen reader announcements on diffs
   - Change eyeline by +1
   - Expect aria-live polite: “Julian total updated, plus 3 from eyeline”

Left-handed mode
14. Mirrored steppers and toggle alignment
   - Enable left-handed mode; “+” appears left; primary CTA ripple origin left

Error states
15. Network error on Save
   - Simulate 500 on POST
   - Expect inline toast “Save failed. Check connection and try again.” and retry affordance

## Accessibility Specification — WCAG AA

Reference context: extends the prior guidelines defined in [docs/ui-ux-spec.md](docs/ui-ux-spec.md)

Baseline targets
- Conformance: WCAG 2.2 AA for color contrast, focus visibility, keyboard support, and motion preferences
- Minimum touch target: 44 × 44 px; add 6 px hit slop where layout permits
- Typography: ensure tabular-nums on all numeric readouts for alignment consistency

Color contrast and usage
- Text on cream (#FAF7F0): use deep navy (#0D1B2A) for AA body and headings
- Text on navy: use white (#FFFFFF), verify 4.5:1 AA for body; icons ≥ 24 px at 3:1
- Primary button: muted gold (#C8A96A) with white text; ensure contrast ≥ 4.5:1; if under, darken gold to #B99957 for AA conformance
- Dividers and hints: cool gray (#C7CDD6) at 40–60% opacity; never use for essential text

Color‑blind palettes (toggle cycles defaults → Deuteranopia → Protanopia → Tritanopia)
- Default accents
  - Deep red #B22E2E
  - Royal blue #2A4CBF
  - Sunny yellow #F4C020
  - Forest green #2C7A4B
- Deuteranopia‑friendly (increase separation of green hues)
  - Red #B22E2E
  - Blue #2648A8
  - Yellow #E3B100
  - Teal‑green #2A9D8F
- Protanopia‑friendly (shift red away from green band)
  - Magenta‑red #A23B72
  - Blue #2A4CBF
  - Yellow‑gold #D9A400
  - Green #287E5E
- Tritanopia‑friendly (separate blue/yellow confusion)
  - Red #B22E2E
  - Violet #6A4FBF
  - Orange #E07A1F
  - Green #2C7A4B
- Implementation notes
  - Palette toggle previews all four colors simultaneously with labels
  - Always pair color with text and iconography; color is not the only cue (e.g., chips include color name text)

Keyboard support map
- Global navigation: Tab/Shift+Tab to move; Enter/Space to activate
- Steppers (role spinbutton): ArrowUp/Right +1, ArrowDown/Left −1, Home = min, End = max
- Prestige reorder (focusable list)
  - Ctrl+ArrowLeft/Right moves focused chip L/R before lock
  - Enter begins drag mode (optional); Esc cancels
- Accordion:
  - Enter/Space toggles open/close
  - Home/End jump to first/last accordion header within the list
- Results table (Leaderboard): Arrow keys navigate cells if table focus mode is implemented; otherwise row focus + Enter to open details

Screen reader semantics
- Live regions
  - Player total changes: aria-live="polite" announce deltas, e.g., “Julian total updated, plus 6 from eyeline”
  - Toast container: aria-live="polite" to announce feedback
- Roles/labels
  - Steppers: role="spinbutton" with aria-valuemin/max/now; aria-label includes color name or metric
  - Toggles/checkboxes: labels include their effect, e.g., “Full Gallery +5”
  - Accordion headers: button with aria-expanded; content region labeledby header id
  - Prestige list: role="listbox" or sortable list pattern with announced position changes
- Focus order: Header → Prestige Track chips (L to R) → Player cards top to bottom (name → painting steppers → eyeline if visible → bonuses → penalties → card summary) → fixed footer CTA

Motion and reduced motion
- Default animations:
  - Press feedback 120–160 ms; expand/collapse 200–250 ms
  - Winner shimmer: single 1.2 s pass
- prefers-reduced-motion
  - Replace movements with cross-fade; reduce durations by ~30%
  - Disable shimmer/confetti entirely

Left‑handed mode mirroring
- Global toggle in Game Setup; immediate application without page reload
- Steppers: “+” button placed on left, “−” on right; value kept centered
- Toggles/checkboxes: control and label left-aligned inside each content block
- Footer CTA: remains full width; ripple origin biased from left edge
- Prestige drag handles: appear on left side of chips for consistent thumb reach

Error, empty, and loading semantics
- Error banners: aria-live="assertive" only when blocking; otherwise use polite toasts
- Empty states include a short next-step action line where relevant (e.g., “Play a game and save results”)
- Skeletons respect reduced motion by disabling shimmer effect

Testing checklist for accessibility
- Contrast passes for all text and essential icons
- Keyboard can perform end-to-end flow: setup → entry → results → save → archives
- SR reads math strings clearly: “Blue 3 times ×5 equals 15; Eyeline 2 times +3 equals +6”
- Reorder controls are operable without drag
- Left-handed mode reflows controls without breaking reading order
